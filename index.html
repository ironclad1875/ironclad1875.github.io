						<h2>I am a aspiring programmer who loves working on new projects and seeing projects through
						</h2>
						<p>I enjoy creating game mechanics and systems seen by players so i work on creating robust code that can be stressed by players. 
						<br />
						I really enjoy testing and bug fixing code as it allows me to learn more.
						<p>				
						<p>	
						I Enjoy working on projects that i havn't work on before and havn't tried before, i see researching, testing and development as all parts under the umbrella of development,
						<br />
						finding out how a system works is just as much fun as actually putting into practice

											<h3>Sweet Thieves </h3>
										</header>
										<p>At the end of my first year of study we had to get into groups and create a game in 3 months, with 3 programmers, 
											2 designers and 6 artists we created a local multiplayer party game, where players were chamelions fighting for resources which were pancakes, 
											players could steal from each-others bases, directly from player and launch themselves with their tongues. i worked on the player movement, 
											player interaction, respawn and stealing mechanics within the game. itch.io Link.</p>

											<h3>Welcome To The Dark</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Welcom To The Dark is a horror game set in a space station that was built with a 60's asthetic in the living quaters, 
											the player makes their way through the station trying to escape, 
											they are watched by a humanoid that lurks around corners and chased by a living suit that can jump to other suits to get closer to the player. 
											I worked on Both the AI and some of the smaller parts in the game, including interactions with terminals, notes and scrpited AI interactions. 
											Working on this project was really enjoyable and tought me a lot, 
											the AI took a lot of work but im happy with what ive been able to do as this is my first time implementing AI into a game where they interact with the player and have to act like living things.</p>

											<h3>Space Vikings</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Space Vikings was an interesting game to work on, 
											we took elemetns from the original atroids game and made it 2 player, 
											with a pvp element, players had to dodge astroids that would break into smaller parts when destoryed, 
											they also had to try shoot the other player. players had a range of powerups that would help them or could hinder them depending on the situation, 
											in all the game was created in 3 days with a team of 4, 2 desingers and 2 programmers.</p>

											<h3>Space Wrestling Hell</h3>
										</header>
										<p>For our second game jam in my second year of study we where given a random name generated from a program, 
											we had to make a game to fit that name. i think we did pretty well with what we got. this game is a fighting game where 2 players try to push eachother off the platform while also trying to dodge the astroids coming down from above. i worked on the player controller and adding in all the animations.</p>
